# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, where I showcase some of the projects I have worked on as a Full Stack web developer. Here, you will find a variety of web applications that I have built from scratch, demonstrating my skills in both front-end and back-end development.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for building interactive and appealing user interfaces.
- Frameworks and libraries like React.js and Angular for developing modern and scalable web applications.
- PHP for creating servers and implementing server-side logic.
- Databases like MySQL for storing and managing data.
- Git and version control to keep track of changes in the source code.
